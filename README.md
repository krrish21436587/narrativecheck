# 🧠 Narrative Consistency Checker  
**Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (KDSH) 2026**

An AI-powered system for validating whether a hypothetical character backstory is logically consistent with a long-form fictional narrative using causal reasoning, temporal tracking, and evidence-based verification.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Modern stories, novels, and fictional universes are massive — often exceeding 100,000 words — making it nearly impossible to manually verify whether a character’s claimed past aligns with what actually happened in the story.

The **Narrative Consistency Checker** solves this by:

- Extracting claims from a hypothetical backstory  
- Locating supporting or contradicting evidence inside a long narrative  
- Tracking events across time  
- Applying causal and character-based constraints  
- Producing a **binary consistency verdict**  
- Providing **verbatim evidence quotes** from the original text  

This allows writers, editors, game designers, and narrative AI systems to validate story logic automatically.

## 🧩 Core Capabilities

### 📚 Long-Context Reasoning
Processes full novels (100,000+ words) without losing continuity.

### 🧠 Causal & Temporal Tracking
Understands how events affect one another across time.

### 🧬 Constraint-Based Logic
Tracks character, timeline, and world-state constraints to detect contradictions.

### 🔍 Evidence Linking
Every verdict is backed by **exact quotes** extracted from the story.

### 📊 Structured Output
Results are exportable in machine-readable format for downstream analysis.

## 🛤 Supported Research Tracks

This system supports two evaluation pipelines, allowing both symbolic and neural reasoning approaches:

### **Track A — NLP & Generative AI**
Uses the **Pathway framework** to:
- Extract claims
- Search long documents
- Align story evidence
- Perform LLM-based reasoning

### **Track B — BDH-Driven Narrative Reasoning**
Uses a structured **Behavior-Driven Hypothesis (BDH)** model to:
- Track story state over time
- Enforce narrative constraints
- Perform consistency checking using symbolic logic

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Ingestion**
   - The full story (novel or narrative text)
   - A hypothetical character backstory

2. **Claim Extraction**
   - The system extracts factual claims from the backstory  
     *(e.g., “The character lost his arm before the war”)*

3. **Evidence Mining**
   - The system searches the story for relevant passages

4. **Constraint Tracking**
   - Time, causality, and character state are tracked across the narrative

5. **Reasoning & Verdict**
   - The system evaluates whether all claims are consistent  
   - Output is **CONSISTENT** or **INCONSISTENT**

6. **Explainability Layer**
   - Supporting or contradicting quotes are returned verbatim

## 📥 Inputs

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Story Narrative** | Complete novel or story text (`.txt`) |
| **Hypothetical Backstory** | Character backstory to verify (`.txt`) |
| **Story ID (optional)** | Used for exporting structured results |

---

## 📤 Output

The system produces:

- A **binary consistency judgment**
- A structured `results.csv`
- Evidence excerpts for each evaluated claim
- Constraint violation logs (for Track B)

---

## 🏗 Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI  
- **Reasoning Engine:** Pathway + custom narrative logic  
- **Data Processing:** Streaming document ingestion, constraint tracking  
- **Output:** Structured CSV + explainable evidence links

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Large fictional universes power:
- Games
- Movies
- AI roleplay
- Interactive storytelling
- Writer collaboration tools

Yet they suffer from:
- Retcons
- Plot holes
- Character inconsistencies

This project provides a **scalable, automated solution** to narrative integrity — turning stories into verifiable systems.

## 🏆 Hackathon Context

Built for  
**Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2026**

Theme: **AI-Driven Narrative Intelligence & Reasoning Systems**

---

## 📌 Project Vision

We envision a future where:
- Stories are logically validated like code
- Character histories are machine-verifiable
- AI systems can reason about fiction with human-level consistency

This project is the first step toward **formal narrative intelligence**.
